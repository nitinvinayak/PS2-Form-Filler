Before post tanning, skin undergo several chemical and physical changes which withdraw lubrication from the fibers present in the skin. Fatliquoring is an important step for leather making. It endows strength and softness to leather by lubricating its fibers. Usually fat liquors prepared by the use of oils with the help of chemical modifications or by the use of surfactants. The processes require more time, efforts and chemicals. Thus there is need of advance process which can be pathbreak for the post tanning process. Preparation of lubricating product will be carried out with the chemical modification to the fatty acids without the use of oil. The resultant product will be characterized for the physical and chemical analysis. The product will be applied in the post tanning operation of leather processing and finally experimental leather will be analyses for the physical testing such as tear strength, tensile strength, and lastometer test etc.The process requires less chemicals, less experimental techniques and it is cheaper than other processes.
PROJECT-2: Unlike polymer gel, 3D supramolecular soft gels are built from the self-assembly of low molecular weight(LMW) compounds which are driven various non-covalent interactions. Supramolecular gels grasp more attention in recent years due to their increasing applications in diverse fields. Particularly, composite supramolecular gels composed of gelators and guest molecule(s) for targeted applications drug delivery) gains importance due to the significance of supramolecular gel property such as self-healing, stimuli-responsive, easy synthesis and purification, etc. Herein, it is proposed to develop 3D soft materials with nanoparticle as guest molecule in a stimuli-responsive self-healing supramolecular soft gel system and to study their applications including drug delivery.
PROJECT-3: Proteins under stressful conditions can lead to the formation of an ordered self-assembled structure, referred to as amyloid fibrils, to which many neurodegenerative diseases such as Type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, etc., are attributed. It is, therefore, necessary and essential to develop efficient sensor as well as an inhibitor (therapeutics) of protein fibril formation which are associated with various diseases. It is proposed that inhibition of such protein fibril formation using small molecules is one of the main therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression of these diseases. Currently, a vast number of natural and synthetic small molecules have been identified as inhibitors of protein fibrillation in vitro. However, these molecules showed their anti-fibrillar activity either at higher concentrations or adverse effects. In this line, functionalized metal nanoparticles have been synthesized and shown as an inhibitor against protein fibrillation. However, these metal nanoparticles were functionalized homogeneously with selected small bioactive molecules or inhibitors. This project, on the other hand, envisaged to develop strategically designed multi bioactive molecules functionalized metal/biomacromolecule nanoparticle-based artificial molecular chaperones for the effective inhibition as well as sensing of protein fibrillation. Such an attempt is believed to deliver efficient sensor as well as high efficacy therapeutic drugs for the effective inhibition of diseases related to protein fibrillation. Similar work will be extended to the inhibition of excess deposition of collagen which is associated with fibrosis.

PROJECT-10: Development of nanofibers using electrospinning technique will be carried out. Though the morphology of nanofibers can be tuned in large by balancing the parameters, the performance of nanofibers can be enhanced only by functionalizing them with active agents based on the choice of application. Metal Organic Framework (MOF) will be incorporated into the nanofibers for efficient drug delivery and other applications.
PROJECT-11: Hydrogen is considered a clean and green fuel as it gives out large energy and produces only water after combustion. The intricate task is to reversibly store hydrogen and release it. Solid chemical hydrogen storage sources are considered better due to the high-density packing of solids. However, defining proper methods to regulate hydrogen generation from such solid chemical hydrogen sources seems to be a challenging task. This could be achieved by engineering integrated nanomachinery, performing a cascade of events in confined spaces as same as an enzyme Hydrogen is considered a clean and green fuel as it gives out large energy and produces only water after combustion.

PROJECT-12: The entire world has started resuming its economic activity with new normalcy norms. SARS COV-2 pandemic is causing widespread concern and hardship for all the business stakeholders across the globe. The situation has changed in such a fashion that it’s not the business as usual. Process industries are not an exception from this new normalcy code of practice. This has prompted to study and analyze the major criteria where potential lacunae persist with respect to process safety in any chemical process industry. Eventually one can develop new SOPs for a process by studying the earlier accidents/incidents.
PROJECT-13: Chemical Process Industries pose many operational challenges and hazardous situations, which need to be assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively in a comprehensive manner. Current methodologies have many shortcomings such as incomplete description of operational sequence and accident occurrence. Using modified techniques that combine both the features of fault and event tree analysis it is possible to assess and manage risks effectively.
PROJECT-14: Unlike chemical processes, bioprocess modeling is complex due to several process variables, and unsteady state. We have batch and fed-batch data for a yeast enzyme production studied in a biocalorimeter. The student would be developing a heat-based model for predicting product and biomass profiles.

PROJECT-18: Leather processing industry generates significant amount of solid wastes that are primarily protein-rich in nature. These wastes are categorized under hazardous category. The disposal of these solid wastes are usually done by incineration or landfilling. The under-utilized solid waste comprises of a structural protein called collagen. Collagen is biocompatible, biodegradable and piezoelectric in nature. These functional properties can be exploited to fabricate biodegradable flexible printed circuit boards that may replace conventional fiber reinforced plastic (FR-4) based substrates. The flexible printed circuit boards will be characterized for its conductivity, sheet resistance, dielectric properties, water resistance and biodegradability under specified conditions. The utilization of solid waste for PCB fabrication would enable to tackle the growing electronic waste problem. The alternative that will emerge out of this research work would add value to the waste solving the pollution issue caused by leather industry waste as well.
PROJECT-19: In the field of tissue engineering, Carbohydrates are inevitable as a possible stabilizing agent for the preparation of functional biomaterial. The biofabrication of these sugars in to aldehydes remain significant factor in achieving promising applications. The nature of bio aldehydes depends on the mode of administration and its applicability. The characterisation relies on the crosslinking efficiency, fibrillogenesis of collagen, gelling and swelling properties. The novelty trusts on the source of carbohydrates and its preparatory models to find its versatile application in the biomedical field. Biocompatibility of the prepared material is the major aspect translate to the technology. This investigation paves forward an avenue in the context of preparation of smart biomaterial with a new crosslinking agent.
PROJECT-20: The food and food related substances in majority depend on the choices of sustainability factor. Globally, the waste to wealth phenomenon stands distinct in the cleaner technology process. The bio based products mainly relies on the authentic quality food products in achieving the impregnable mode of preparation, production and consumption by the consumer. Interestingly collagen among all its varied functions can be fabricated in to food products for animal region. The preparatory method of collagen from waste and the optimization protocols remain crucial for the present study. Moreover, the exploring the different forms, texture, purpose and additives in the manufacturing protocol remain significant. Exclusively, extra nutritional agents can be added in order to obtain the holistic product for further advancement.
PROJECT-21: CSIR-CLRI hosts several inimitable skill training models for different levels of manpower – primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The main objective of the study is to analyse the various skill training models (accredited skill training courses) offered by CSIR-CLRI for the leather, leather products and allied sectors. The modular orientation of each course will be analysed to take stock of the degree of uniqueness in the respective course and techniques by which the skill is imparted specific to this industry can be analysed in detail. CSIR-CLRI hosts a feedback mechanism for its various programmes; the feedback accumulated so far will be analysed. The effectiveness of conventional vs. novel skill initiatives implemented by CSIR-CLRI will be analysed to suggest further improvisations in the system. Recommendations for fabricating a more robust feedback mechanism will also evolve.
PROJECT-22: Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the desired model organisms in evaluating the most of the therapeutic compounds. Primarily, the homology and genetic pattern of C. elegans sets parallel array with that of human. These transparent nematodes are easy to handle in the small laboratory practices compared to that of other models. On other hand, alteration in the glucose homeostasis occupy large component in the human population. High glycemic index diets acts as an obese determinant factor in the recent times. Addressing this factor, a step ahead is taken by fusing naturally occurring antiglycating agents to annotate the glucose level in the C. elegans model. The host-drug interaction mechanism may be studied extensively both chemically and biologically using microscopic imaging and advanced techniques. Hence, this study intensifies the drive of antiglycating agents towards therapeutic practices.
PROJECT-23: New-fangled technology evolved in the field of bio therapeutics is 3D Bioprinting. In recent times, Biofabrication of cells, biomaterials and the biopolymers are developed in the preparation of inks for bio printing technology. The unique optimization for employing protein based organic materials is used to prepare the regenerative medicine in the present study. This implies the organisation of layering process for generating three dimensional solid objects. Development of protein based bioinks is being evaluated for their printability based on their rheological and biological properties. Structural fidelity is stabilized by crosslinking methods, consuming time and their adaptability to conserved microenvironment is assessed using In vitro assays. In worldwide, researchers are under way in developing a fully functioning bio printing process to develop a holistic model. Hence, this study will be an unique biomimetic approach to develop bioinks from collagen/gelatin and polysaccharides for its potential use in tissue engineering application.
PROJECT-24: Development of application tool to maintain the complex datasets of students. This project aims in developing user friendly tool that simplify the tasks of managing the data, extracting, sorting and report generation as per the user requirement.
PROJECT-25: Automated Leather Vision Inspection system for inspection of defects and grading. Camera autonomously scans the leather under test and captures the image of the entire leather surface. The system detects defects such as natural, processing as well as other category of leather defects. It is a non-contact test method. Defect segmentation and classification using state of art deep learning methods are being developed.
PROJECT-26: The extraction of water soluble form of Peanut shell can be utilized for the reatnning cum fatliquoring agent. The use of natural products for the leather application is focused here. The chemical and physical analysis of the product will be carried out.
PROJECT-27: Leather manufacturing involves three major wet processes viz., pre-tanning, tanning and post tanning with the usage of water, synthetic chemicals, bio chemicals and mechanical operations. Pre tanning involves cleaning/removal of unwanted proteinous materials and prepared for further processing. Tanning is the process by which stabilization of protein i.e., collagen will take place. Post tanning process is done to incorporate required properties according to the leather end use. In post tanning, chemicals like syntans (synthetic tanning agents) and synthetic/natural fatliquors are majorly used in order to achieve the required properties of a leather. The syntans and fatliquors have several classifications namely phenol-naphthalene condensation, urea-melamine, acrylics, sulfated, sulfited, sulfonated, etc. These post tanning chemicals are offered in mixed compositions when compared to other processes. The exhaustion of these post tanning chemicals is reported to be around 80 – 85% and rest goes into waste stream. Hence it is complicated to check the degradability of individual components present in spent post tan liquor. Though, the biodegradability of the few syntans and fatliquors before offer had been reported. However, degradability of syntans and fatliquors or its exhaustion behavior is less reported. Hence it is proposed to carry out a detailed characterization of commercially used syntans and fatliquors which would help in the improvement of exhaustion of chemicals in leather processing or reduce the environmental threats.

"4943","Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research(Kalpakkam)","Electronics","0","Kalpakkam","A3, A8, AA,","PROJECT-1: Ion Mobility Spectrometer (IMS) is a hand held device popularly being used at strategic places for tracing explosives and narcotics. Key component in IMS is the sensor sniffing the “odours” and translate it in to a spectrograph displaying various peaks, with the peak position in the time axis identifying the contrabands and the peak height representing its concentration. Bench top IMS machines have been developed successfully using indigenous components by IGCAR and field tested through ECIL. However, two key components –the pulsed high voltage power supply and pre-amplifier are still being imported. Development of these two components would make the unit completely indigenous. The student needs to identify appropriate IC chips, HV cakes and other electronic components, required noise filtering based on literature survey and market availability. Circuit needs to be designed with software and to be given for fabrication. The fabricated board needs to be tested in the IMS unit available at IGCAR. IGCAR mentor will take care of fabrication (and cost of fabrication). Students need to visit IGCAR for final testing
PROJECT-2: The project involves wet-chemical synthesis and characterization of substituted SnO2, In2O3 and ZnO materials. The thin films of these materials will be deposited either by electron beam evaporation and/or pulsed laser deposition and will be characterized by glancing angle XRD, SEM and AFM etc. The thick/thin films will be tested towards the gases like H2, NH3, NOx and volatile organic solvents and the data will be analysed by multivariate chemometric tools
PROJECT-3: The solubility of organophosphorous compounds will be measured in supercritical carbon dioxide medium using flow saturation technique. The solubility will be measured at various pressures (80 to 250 bar) and as a function of temperature. The solubility data would be modeled as a function of SCCO2 density and other parameters using semi-empirical models.
PROJECT-4: Injection casting process is filling the mold cavity with molten against gravity and then solidification under pressure to produce defect free cast rods. Injection casting process has inherent advantages for producing long thin slender rods with maximum yield. The casting parameters for injection casting technique is melt temperature, pressurization rate, mold material, preheating temperature and cooling rate. Manufacturing defect free cast rods requires study on the influence of the casting parameters for various compositions of alloys, casting speed and cooling rate. Finite element technique with COMSOL multiphysics analysis tool can be used to study the thermal hydraulics parameters like molten metal filling velocity against the preheat temperature of the mold, pressurization rate and cooling rate. Minimization of heel of the injection casting requires optimization of clearance between crucible bottom and mold tip for filling of molten metal with less resistance. The various mold shape and flow path resistance shall be modeled and analyzed for minimization of heel.
PROJECT-5: In the Metallic Fuel Fabrication laboratory, handling of highly reactive materials is carried out in a negative pressure inert (argon) gas loaded Glove Box Train. The continuous circulation of argon gas is carried out to meet the requirement of controlling the oxygen and moisture impurity levels below acceptable threshold, which is caused by the ingress of ambient air into the system and also to maintain the argon atmosphere at a constant temperature, by continuously cooling it. We have an automated PLC controlled gas purification & re-circulating system which allows for one tower to be regenerated while the other is active. A tower with adsorber bed column (reactor) utilizes a Zeolite based molecular sieve for removing moisture and removal of Oxygen is performed by means of a copper catalyst. An adequate argon circulation rate is maintained to keep the moisture content in the Glove Box Train down to 10 ppm, as the moisture content in the leaking in air is ~7 % as compared to 19.5 % of oxygen. A constant flow rate of 2000 Nl/min is maintained for; O2 concentration &lt;10 ppm @ 400 Nl/min; moisture concentration &lt;10 ppm @ 400 Nl/min and feed-bleed rate calculated by a mass balance on nitrogen in the Glove Box. A recirculation blower, with adequate flow of 150m3/h with ?P = 100mbar maintains the same. The design of adsorption column will help to determine the important design parameters like amount of adsorbents needed for specified removal, column dimensions etc. Analytical calculation, modelling & analysis of heat & mass transfer of the layered column bed operation can be done using commercial software for gas-solid chemical reactions, catalytic process and physical adsorption process in the column bed. The analysis will be key to optimize the lifetime of the adsorbants, meeting the performance in terms of dew point, adsorption time, pressure drop, rate of removal of oxygen with flow rate, role of oxygen partial pressure, temperature or pressure effects, time schedule required to meet the purity level, the change in density of argon at different temperatures and pressures, reaction rate as a function of leaks or permeation etc.,
PROJECT-6: In electrostatic ion accelerators, the ion source plays a major role among other subsystems by generating the ion beam of desired species and charge state. This ion beam is then transported down the beam line and injected into the accelerator for further acceleration. The density distribution of particles over the two transverse coordinates x (horizontal) and y (vertical) is called beam profiles. While transporting, it is essential to know the beam profile for lossless and efficient injection into the subsequent accelerators. Beam profile measurement and their continuous monitoring are important during routine machine operation as well as for accelerator experiments to optimize the beam line parameters and study various ion beam parameters such as emittance and space charge effects. Determination of the beam profiles in both x and y axes is important for phase space matching at different parts of an accelerator. The devices like harps, profile grids, SEM grids, and residual gas ionization monitors are the nondestructive or nearly nondestructive devices, and viewing screens are destructive devices for this purpose. Wire scanners and harps are mostly employed for beam profile measurement. Harp is a device which can perform the beam profile measurement in both x and y axes with considerably higher speed than any other devices. It is a meshlike device made of wires laid in horizontal and vertical directions in the same plane. The mesh is exposed to ion beam and the currents from the multiple wires are fed to the individual channel of current to voltage converter. The converted voltages are then read out sequentially and the transverse profiles are reproduced from the data. Different beam parameters like beam emittance, twiss parameter, and beam position can be calculated using this device. In the actual usage, Harp grid is placed inside the beam chamber with electronics placed outside. The connection between them is made by a number of signal lines passing through a vacuum feedthrough. It is also possible to develop the harp device with onboard processing electronics placed inside the vacuum. This proposal is for developing a simple and efficient HARP based ion beam diagnostic system with enhanced accuracy in the measurement for low beam currents. The developed device is planned to be used at low energy accelerators at MSG,IGCAR. It will greatly complement and work as an import substitute for the existing wire scanner type imported BPMs. HARP Grid Design The harp device is to be designed considering a maximum beam current of 100 µA after the analyzing dipole for any charge state and to keep the overall dimension of the instrument to be 75 mm × 75 mm. A 13 × 13 (X × Y) channel wire harp grid is to be made from gold plated tungsten wire of suitable diameter (~few 10s of µm). The detachable “X” and “Y” grids will be made on separate square shaped glass epoxy frames with grid wires soldered on both ends with the frame. The “X” and “Y” frames are stacked one above the other keeping sufficient (~4-5 mm) gap in between. Further designs parameters like length, pitch,diameter are to be made considering various factors like range of currents to be measured, heat dissipation capability,etc. Signal Processing and read out electronics design The readout electronics to be developed in house will comprise of the five major components like (a) a multichannel and multi ranging transimpedance amplifier ie current to voltage converter, (b) a high precision analog signal chain, (c) an analog to digital converter (ADC), (d) an embedded system in the form of a high end microcontroller or FPGA controller, and (e) communication block (serial/Ethernet). This completes instrumentation for a single current measurement channel. Design, simulation, fabrication and testing of all these stages individually as well as integrated will be done. The transimpedance amplifier converts the beam current (few nA to 10uA ) along with the secondary emission read by each grid wire and converts it to an equivalent voltage. The voltage output is processed by the precision analog signal chain and converted into digital signals by the ADC stage. This ADC shall, through I2C/SPI interface, shall communicate the conversion results to the embedded system. The current of the individual wire is plotted against the wire location to obtain the ion beam distribution, i.e., the ion beam profile along the X and Y axes in the beam line. All channels are read sequentially first X then Y and the data are sent to the embedded system over the I2C/SPI bus. The embedded controller forms a packet using the measured data and sends it over the Ethernet /RS232 interface to the control room PC. Necessary LabVIEW based programs need to be developed for use at the control room PC to communicate, receive the data, convert them back to the corresponding current and display both the X and Y profiles. The complete system is to be designed onto a 75 mm × 75 mm printed circuit board (PCB) having (30-40) mm × (30-40) mm aperture at the centre to accommodate the harp grid. For X-Y profiling, optimized instrumentation for 169 channels (i.e reading the 13 channels of both X and Y axes) is to be developed alongwith suitable DC-DC based power supplies and necessary protection circuits. Necessary mechanical assembly will be designed to accommodate the harp mesh along with the electronics making them suitable for being kept in the beam line vacuum. While designing the mechanical assembly and electronics, the thermal aspects of the device will have to be duly considered taking heat generated in the mesh and the electronics into account separately are considered separately. At the end of the project, it is expected that the student would develop and acquire a very good working knowledge/expertise of embedded programming, programmable instrumentation using Xilinx or Altera FPGAs, precision circuit design to handle pA-µA and uV-V level signals, circuit analysis and simulation using pSpice/Matlab, GUI design and implementation using VB/C++/labVIEW, multilayer PCB design, consolidation and analysis of data emanating from the project. Hence it is desirable for the student to have a very good familiarity and basic working knowledge in these areas.

The FTL (Full Truck Load) team focuses on trucking and solve problems like driver&apos;s lifestyle and load transit time. One big problem in logistics is the driver&apos;s lifestyle, as drivers are usually away from home for about 20 to 30 days. Rivigo is solving this by the patented algorithm of relay and driver allocation. A truck moves through many pitstops during its journey from source to destination; at each pitstop, a new driver is allocated to drive the truck to the next pitstop and the previous driver is allocated a truck that returns him to his home pitstop. This ensures shorter duty hours and faster load movement as the truck doesn&apos;t have to wait for the driver&apos;s rest. Algorithms coordinate with drivers using a smartphone-based app. In FTL, we are working on many ground breaking projects: - Integration of IoT devices such as tyre pressure sensor, GPS, Fuel level sensor and AI cameras to detect drivers&apos; attention - Network balance algorithm, which controls the movement of the truck so that the availability of consignments, trucks, and drivers is balanced - Optimizing mileage based on data from fuel and pressure sensor and controlling fuel and air filling - Safety alerts based on Realtime data provided by AI camera and tyre temperature sensor - Direct driver behavior using performance and psychology-based incentive model - Probabilistic model for expenses approval 2. Warehouse planning: When moving shipments, the shipments are aggregated in a warehouse. The warehouse has a limited space, and given the amount of shipment it is important to plan the shipment location inside the warehouse. The optimal location improves warehouse utilisation as well as reduces the loading and unloading time.

Before the electricity arrangement can expand by the degree required to deliver universal electricity access in a reliable and clean manner, there are several issues that need to be resolved. Foremost, the focus is on the areas of innovative, fast, precise and affordable monitoring and control of the system. This can give a huge boost to the viability of solar/renewable technology, & have strong positive effects on the drivers of their profitability – revenues, tariffs and costs. Strong monitoring capabilities also give confidence to investors and donors, along with enhancing the customer experience by improving the availability, reliability, and quality of supply and increasing convenience and information about usage. There are several issues like weather, shadowing, panel degradation, poor design, and usage of inferior material, which cause losses up to 50% of the production over the years. We are developing a low-cost, easy-to-install, high-tech monitoring solution that keeps users, owners, & service providers constantly up to date on the solar system’s performance, and ensures rapid maintenance & a continuous return on the investment. SmartHelio will monitor the solar panels, batteries & loads, run machine learning models for predictive analysis and generate intelligent business insights. It will also act as a smart meter & report solar energy usage to the service provider, which will help them in invoicing and revenue collection from the end-users in case of 3rd party-owned systems.

Ltd.(Bangalore)","IT","50000","Bangalore","A7, A7B1, A7B2, A7B3, A7B4, A7B5, H103, H112,","PROJECT-1: &Double;VMware continues building on previous work launched as part of the SDDC Industrialization effort to substantially increase customer satisfaction in operation of VMware products for Customers by dismantling barriers to realizing the full benefits of the SDDC in the Enterprise. The chartered scope has previously included vSphere, VSAN, NSX, and vRealize Suite. VMware Cloud Foundation is the hybrid cloud platform for managing VMs and orchestrating containers, built on full stack hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) technology. With a single architecture that is easy to deploy, VMware Cloud Foundation enables consistent, secure infrastructure and operations across private and public cloud. Increase enterprise agility and flexibility with the hybrid cloud that delivers it all. There are multiple workstreams of VCF. Few of them are listed as follows: - • Lifecycle Management - Automate install / upgrade / patch processes; Improve error recovery. • Certificate Management - Automate certificate replacement & standardize certificate management. • Password Management – Standard way to manage the credentials across multiple products within VCF • Health Monitoring & Reporting - Standardize monitoring of product faults & failures. • System Availability - Ensure system resilience to failure at any level–service, rack, human error, etc. • Regulatory Compliance & Public Sector - Minimum compliance standards met. • Public APIs & SDK – Provide standard REST APIs for enterprise customers and developers to integrate with the VCF workflows. • AuthN & AuthZ – Standard Authentication mechanism for SDDC manager UI and for the Public APIs. Support for role-based access for meeting the requirements of security and compliance regulations. Certificate Management service provides mechanism to orchestrate and replace SSL/TLS certificates programmatically with a consistent user experience across all the SDDC (Software Defined Data Center) components. It adds an ability to monitor and audit centrally the integrity/validity of all the certificates used in SDDC and notify user prior to certificate expiration to prevent service interruption. Some of the use cases which are being designed are around generation of CSR requests, replacing of certificates, import of certificates, health monitoring, secure backup of certificates etc. Password Management consists of 3 core capabilities, which together enable a rich feature-set for Customers to manage their passwords in a SDDC: 1. Password Lookup: This feature enables the customer to lookup the passwords of the SDDC components. To use this feature, it is important that the user has the required roles and permissions 2. Password Update/Rotate/Remediate: This capability enables the customer to manage all types of credentials from within SDDC manager. This could be as a result of the compliance regulations or to prevent the expiry of the passwords 3. Service Accounts: This feature ensures that the machine accounts are used to access other services. These are system-maintained accounts and the passwords are not known to the end users and maintained or consumed by the SDDC manager or the underlying SDDC components. AuthN/AuthZ - VMware&apos;s products are sometimes on-premise, sometimes they are cloud services and few times only a portion is part of the cloud services. Hence there is a need for the products to support federated identity of service accounts and authentication, Common tenancy models and authorization patterns for RBAC, roles, permissions. SDDC manager in VCF uses embedded PSC (and Workspace One access in future) as its authentication component. A single user account from a customer’s identity source can be used for SSO for all products in VCF. It is also important to ensure that the users have the right permissions to perform various operations in VCF. This is facilitated by the RBAC model which manages the permissions, roles and also the use of service accounts for internal communications. Currently VCF supports 3 inbuilt roles and in future this would extend to have more inbuilt and customer roles. &Double; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Self diagnostics of ESX &Double;When PSOD happens, panic procedure dumps the kernel core at certain dump location and provides a debug prompt. This debug prompt will then allow user (GSS, SRE, R&D engineer) to run various diagnostics tools. Diagnostic tools and plugins will be located on a RAM based VFAT storage. A core dump may not contain all the memory locations relevant to panic. Such limitation can affect users ability to triage the issue. Goal of diagnostics tools is to create a report that helps user to triage the issue efficiently. Diagnostics should check for possibility of hardware malfunction (MCEs, SMIs, repeated panics on same core). If software bug is suspected, diagnostics should identify module (vmkcore, 3rd party vendor, storage or networking). Based on this classification, diagnostics logic should invoke corresponding module specific diagnostics plugin. Diagnostics tool will be developed in C language. It should provide a scalable framework. Other teams should be able to write their own diagnostic plugins using this framework. &Double; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Golang on ESXi - Improvements &Double;a. Delve on ESX : Delve is the debugger of choice for Go programming language. Delve has to be ported for ESXi so that Go applications running on ESX can be live debugged. The porting work involves a good understanding of the underlying userland layer of the VMkernel and how debuggers work. A working version of delve on ESX for an old version of Go(1.10?) is available. However, a lot of changes has been made to the Go runtime ever since 1.10 was released and delve needs to keep up the pace with the updated runtime. It’s a challenging project and will expose the intern to all things system. b. Resource Pool Aware Allocator: Applications running in the userland on ESX are tightly restricted when it comes to the resources – memory and cpu. All the applications have to configure a maximum memory limit within which they have to operate. The idea is to make changes to the Go runtime memory allocator so that the allocator is aware of the resource pool limits and it schedules the garbage collections, scavenging, heap growth, etc accordingly.&Double; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ VMware’s Cloud Platform Business Unit (CPBU) is focused on enabling a Multi-Cloud, Multi-Device World where seamless delivery of cloud services to end customers across a global network of homogeneous clouds and heterogeneous endpoints is a reality. As part of that effort, we will need to create a new distributed control plane which is known as Multi-VC, leveraging and extending open-source technologies that will be used to manage Multiple VCs. One of the capabilities is Configuration and Compliance service – which will allow the administrators to use the Multi-VC portal to ensure that the vCenter Server instances are compliant with the organization and government policies. We can provision new vCenter Server instances that mirror the exact configuration of the existing environment. We can also monitor this configuration for any deviations from the desired configuration state, when managed by multiple administrators. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &Double;The VC lifecycle team is looking for a developer to work on vSphere Clustering Services. Our customers expect vSphere to always be available and deliver the promised functionality in the face of outages and failures. Customers depend on vCenter for many vSphere operations such as create VM, create snapshot, clone, DRS, and vSphere HA. If vCenter is down these operations become blocked, though running VMs are unaffected and continue to run without any interruption. Several automation programs depend on vCenter APIs to provision VMs and to perform many operations on VMs. A downed vCenter creates many challenges for our customers. Our goal continues to be - make vSphere/SDDC the best platform to run any workload - VMs and Containers. Developers should be able to provision and manage their apps with VMs and Containers without any interruption. Our customers expect cloud-like availability for vSphere/SDDC. To achieve this vSphere must always be available – not just highly available. Many of our global enterprise customers have 100s of vCenters. Though our current vCenter High Availability (VCHA) provides a good solution for customers with a small number of vCenters, it does present challenges for customers with 100s of vCenters.&Double; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SDK for TCA (Java/Python bindings) &Double;* Enable programmatic access to Telco Cloud Orchestration solution * Access features available via REST APIs including VNF Validation, On-boarding, and LCM operations * Sample Code for TCA REST APIs&Double; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cluster Capacity Management &Double;* Planner Help users to plan and optimize K8s cluster capacity for the workloads * Viewer Show users the Workload & Management Cluster view&Double; Maestro is the heart of performance runs scheduling and orchestra, including collecting required stats for analysis. Project is to enhance core storage maestro workflow to include NVMe OF and vVols. vSAN Direct (Cloud native storage) workflow integration with Maestro. Both stand alone and hybrid mode (workflow along with vSAN) is required in Maestro. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Common Hardware Lab: tool for efficient use of Hardware &Double;CHL is a common hardware lab tool similar to nimbus which helps in sharing hardware effectively and reducing idle time of hardware resources.The tool maintains a config file of each testbed having various servers and special configuration. The config file contains the status(occupied, free) of the testbed and tags(manufacturer=dell, model=r330, no_of_cpu=32) based on the configuration. The tool provides an interface to search the tags and submit the test if there is any testbed that exists with selected tags. The job will be pushed into the queue and get executed once the testbed matches with the tags is available. This helps the development and QE and Dev community to search hardware and submit the tests and also make effective utilization of hardware resources.&Double; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
